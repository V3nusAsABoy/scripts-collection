# Collection of Bash/C/Python scripts

This is a collection of scripts in Python, Bash, and C I built in university. The 3380-labs folder contains a series of labs I did for my systems programming course, and the 4370-scripts contain some Python scripts I made for my cybersecurity course. These scripts have a variety of uses such as port scanning, aes decryption, client-server file sharing & transformation, etc.

## How to use

### Requirements

- Latest version of Python
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) if running on Windows

### Clone git repo

Clone the repo in your terminal to access the files.

```git clone https://github.com/V3nusAsABoy/scripts-collection.git```

### Usage

Open the directory in your terminal and navigate through each folder. Each folder has a log file(s) or a screenshot demonstrating how the file can be used. For the 3380-labs scripts, there is a list of instructions at the top showing how to use the script.


Example for lab 2 in 3380-labs:
```
cd lab2
cat lab2.log
```
